            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>With the launch of AR and VR products like Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro, there has been an increasing need for integrating AR features into peopleâ€™s lives. 
                In North America, skiing and snowboarding have been two of the most popular winter sports. 
                However, the technologies have not been particularly on par with the development of sports equipment. </p>
            <p>As skiers and snowboarders ourselves, we often find it helpful if we can have something to monitor our speed and mountain slopes in real-time, and perhaps tell us the temperature and time. 
                For example, a car or a motorcycle has a cockpit telling the driver about their driving status.  
                Cruising at a similar speed to a vehicle in the city, snowboarders and skiers do not have a good way to have such information. </p>
            <p>Our design team plans to develop a detachable Bluetooth Head-Up Display (HUD) that can be easily attached to any ski goggles or helmet. 
                This HUD will solely function as a display unit, connecting with a mobile app to show essential information like speed, compass direction, GPS location, time, and temperature. 
                The app will handle all data processing, allowing the HUD to be energy-efficient with a minimal battery. This detachability ensures our device is compatible with any brand of goggles or helmets, offering flexibility to users. 
                The mobile app will also enable users to personalize their display interface and track their skiing progress. We aim to create a portable device that enhances the user experience. </p>
            <h3>Gaps</h3>
            <p>The rise of AR and VR devices such as Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro has spurred a growing demand for incorporating AR functionalities into daily activities. 
                In North America, skiing and snowboarding stand as highly favored winter sports, yet technological advancements in this realm have not kept pace with those in sports equipment. 
                In our investigation, the limitations of current products are evident. 
            <p>Firstly, customers are required to buy both the goggles and the display functionality as a single unit.
                As a result, skiers are restricted in their choices if they desire the display function, while numerous other professional snow goggle brands exist. </p>
            <p>Secondly, there is limited control over the content displayed on the screen. User interface contains too many widgets, resulting in visual clutter. </p>
            <p>Lastly, the inclusion of various hardware modules adds weight and power consumption to the products, necessitating larger and heavier batteries.</p>
            <h3>Value Proposition</h3>
            <p>During our research, the only product specially made for the above purpose is the Smart Snow Goggles from REKKIE. 
                They have integrated a projector and various hardware modules inside their goggles, which can display some basic information like speed, and altitude, 
                as well as more detailed information such as other users' location and message notifications. 
                However, the drawbacks of REKKIE's product are also prominent. 
                Firstly, customers have to purchase the goggles and their displaying functionalities as a whole, from REKKIE. There are lots of professional snow goggles from different brands, but skiers cannot choose these brands if they want the display function. 
                Secondly, there is not much control over what is shown on the screen. In the current product, the user interface contains too many widgets, which is visually unpleasant. 
                Finally, too many hardware modules make the product heavy and power-consuming, making the battery larger and heavier. </p>

            <p>Our design team wants to propose an idea, aiming to solve these gaps above a detachable Bluetooth HUD that can be mounted onto any helmet or goggles, and a mobile app. 
                The HUD will be used for display only and will be connected to the mobile app so that it saves energy and only carries a small battery as the only weight source. 
                Information and calculations such as speed, Compass, GPS, time, temperature, etc will be provided by the mobile app. 
                The product's detachability will make it non-proprietary, which means users can choose to have their device on or not regardless of what goggles or helmet they are using. 
                The app will be able to let users configure their interface themselves, and it will be able to record users' skiing progress. 
                Customised information makes the screen clean. Since it's only a Bluetooth projector and all data processing is migrated to the mobile app, the product will be portable, concise for display, and lightweight. 
                The goal of this team is to address potential challenges and make this product. </p>
